        <h3>Professional Web Developer</h3>
        <p>A web developer or programmer is someone who takes a web design - which has been created by either a client or a design team - and turns it into a website.

            They do this by writing lines and lines of complicated code, using a variety of languages. Web developers have quite a difficult job, because they essentially have to take a language we understand, such as English, and translate it into a language that a computer understands, such as Python or HTML.</p>
